# AI Code Documentation Study

This repository is dedicated to studying and demonstrating the capabilities of AI in explaining and documenting source code. It serves as a practical example of how modern AI can comprehend and articulate complex technical systems.

## Repository Contents

The main document in this repository (`streaming-explanation.md`) was automatically generated by Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet. It provides a comprehensive technical documentation of the Keboola Streaming service, including:

- Detailed system architecture
- Component descriptions
- Data flow diagrams
- Configuration options
- Performance considerations
- Integration guidelines

## AI Generation Process

The documentation was created using the following prompt:

```
Inspect the and investigate @stream in more depth to uncover what happens to data before they are pushed to Keboola Storage. Create markdown documentation for the product manager, describing the Keboola Streaming service, including all components and principles. The documentation should cover options for tuning the buffer (e.g., how long data are cachedâ€”such as 30 seconds or 1,000 events) and the JSON parsing process. Additionally, include a detailed visual diagram (Mermaid flowchart) illustrating the application's inner logic, with a specific focus on how data flows through the components of the Keboola Streaming service. Ensure the diagram is detailed and store the result in @streaming-explanation.md
```

## Purpose

This repository demonstrates:
1. AI's ability to understand complex technical systems
2. Generation of clear, structured technical documentation
3. Creation of detailed system architecture diagrams
4. Translation of technical concepts into accessible explanations

## Study Notes

The generated documentation showcases how AI can:
- Break down complex systems into understandable components
- Generate detailed technical diagrams using Mermaid
- Provide comprehensive yet clear explanations
- Structure information in a way that's useful for both technical and non-technical audiences
