# Modern Product Management with AI Documentation

This repository outlines the product management principles employed at Keboola, with a focus on using AI to assist in technical documentation. The documentation was generated using Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and covers the following aspects:

- Efficient documentation generation
- Enhanced technical understanding
- Clear visual communication
- Scalable documentation processes

## Overview of Product Documentation

The main document (`streaming-explanation.md`) details the Keboola Streaming service. It serves as an example of how AI can be used to create documentation that includes:

- Detailed descriptions of technical components and principles
- Options for tuning buffers (e.g., caching duration or event counts)
- Explanations of JSON parsing processes
- Detailed visual diagrams (Mermaid flowcharts) showing data flows and system logic

## Product Management Practices at Keboola

This study illustrates several practical approaches:

1. **Efficient Documentation Generation**
   - Use of AI to produce comprehensive technical documentation
   - Reduced time spent on manual documentation maintenance
   - Consistent documentation formats

2. **Technical Understanding**
   - Rapid comprehension of complex systems
   - Translation of technical details for varied audiences
   - Thorough coverage of product architecture and components

3. **Visual Communication**
   - Automated generation of system diagrams
   - Clear visualization of data flows and system interactions
   - Visual aids to support stakeholder understanding

4. **Scalable Documentation Process**
   - Fast updates to documentation as systems change
   - Standardized documentation structure and quality
   - Lower dependency on engineering resources for technical documentation

## AI Generation Process

The documentation was created using the following prompt, demonstrating how AI can be integrated into product management practices:
